# AGENTS.md — WebCodex Repository Guide

These rules apply to ordinary repository work. Read linked domain guidance only when relevant; a deeper `AGENTS.md` governs its directory.

WebCodex is actively developed. Requested features, fixes, and reliability improvements are welcome; preserve credential, process-tree, transport, durability, and boundedness contracts.

## 1. Verify and preserve

- Work only in the repository, worktree, and external targets authorized by the user.
- At task start, verify root, branch, HEAD, status, relevant changes, and recent history. Recheck after Git operations, observed concurrent changes, or before committing.
- Treat prompt paths, hashes, branches, and runtime state as expectations to verify, not permission to overwrite actual state.
- Preserve unrelated and concurrent work. Use guarded edits; do not reset, rebase, restore, clean, or rewrite history without an explicit request for that operation.
- Read only implementation, tests, documentation, and diffs relevant to the task.

## 2. Design for the current need

- Make workflows simple and obvious. Choose the smallest coherent solution with the fewest concepts, states, and maintenance costs. Add abstractions, configuration, or compatibility only for a concrete need; do not build for hypothetical consumers or scale.
- Protect real boundaries: credentials, public entry points, destructive actions, execution targets, history, and published artifacts. Model new authority, credential audiences, and replaceable targets explicitly when sharing scopes, identities, or leases would broaden access or allow stale requests to retarget.
- Prefer structured process/argv and durable Job/observation primitives for model-facing execution. Shell remains an escape hatch; structured lifecycle state owns retry safety.
- Keep ToolSpec/OpenAPI descriptions self-contained and accurate about selection, authority, effects, retries, continuation, uncertainty, and recovery. Use up to `MODEL_TOOL_DESCRIPTION_MAX_CHARS` when needed; arbitrary brevity must not remove semantics.
- Keep core execution and Job semantics protocol-, UI-, transport-, and OS-neutral. Host-specific features such as MCP App orchestration belong in optional adapters.
- HTTP/MCP requests are stateless unless their exact adapter contract supplies a stable `ClientWindow`. Never infer Workflow Session, model-context retention, or authority from transport/audit IDs, credentials, projects, or prior requests. Keep Connector Tasks, Workflow Sessions, durable Agents/Conversations, and Agent Tasks distinct; follow the Session and Agent contracts linked below.

Product direction: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 3. Implement and review

- User outcomes, scope, prohibitions, and acceptance conditions are hard constraints. Suggested files and steps are guidance unless explicitly mandatory; adapt them to verified code and conventions.
- Follow existing architecture and naming. Avoid unrelated cleanup, duplicate representations, speculative compatibility, and broad refactors without a current need.
- For cross-layer features, map the authoritative path before editing and complete it end to end. Update affected enums, registries, schemas, adapters, and projections; do not touch unrelated interfaces merely because they exist.
- Use compiler, type, schema, and exhaustiveness failures to locate missing integration before broadening validation.
- Add focused tests where practical and update documentation when public behavior or operations change.
- Review the completed diff separately from implementation. Check completeness, then relevant authority, bounds, privacy, and replay risks. Match review depth to the change; resolve demonstrated issues without designing around hypothetical reviewer concerns.
- Ask only when required information cannot be discovered, instructions materially conflict, or proceeding could destroy work. Otherwise continue and report material deviations.

## 4. Validate changed behavior

- Start with the smallest check that can detect a regression; stop when sufficient relevant evidence passes. Reuse results when the validated source and relevant dependencies are unchanged. Repeat only after relevant changes, invalidating conflicts, incomplete/flaky runs, or a user request.
- Documentation-only changes need no Cargo compilation or tests. Rust changes normally need affected formatting, the smallest relevant package check when compilation may be affected, and focused tests.
- Use the `dogfood` Cargo profile for optimized development builds; reserve `release` for formal release/publication artifacts.
- Full library/workspace tests, `--all-targets`, ignored tests, real-process harnesses, and E2E are not defaults. Use them for explicit requests, release/deployment, cross-cutting boundaries, broad conflict resolution, or gaps in focused coverage. State the reason first.
- Put tests in existing dedicated module trees, grouped by domain. Keep inline `#[cfg(test)]` blocks small and tied to private helpers; process/network/integration fixtures belong in dedicated test modules.
- Async readiness must use a `wait_*` path with one absolute deadline that progress never resets. Use `probe_*` only when immediate absence is valid or inside an already-owned deadline.
- Distinguish current failures, pre-existing failures, expected negative cases, and failures resolved by retry. Never weaken authentication, authorization, validation, schemas, sandboxing, or tests to get a passing result.

Testing guidance: [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md).

## 5. Deliver only what is authorized

- Never print, commit, or expose credentials, authorization headers, private keys, tokens, secret files, or sensitive command output.
- Before committing, review status and diff. Keep unrelated work separate; do not amend an unrelated commit.
- Push, publish, tag, release, deploy, restart services, or alter external systems only when explicitly requested with a named destination.
- Never force-push, move published tags, overwrite releases, or rewrite published history without an explicit request naming the operation and target. Release operations must also obey the immutable artifact contract below; failed pre-publication tag recovery is permitted only through its explicitly authorized guarded reclaim path.
- Named development/dogfood deployments are separate from releases. Deploy the reviewed source commit, record its build identity without hiding dirty state, preserve rollback, and run focused smoke. They do not authorize version bumps, tagging, or publication.
- Before finishing, check the final diff, whitespace, worktree, conflicts, and active jobs. Report the outcome, changed files/targets, validation, Git/job state, material deviations, and remaining risks. State whether push, publication, deployment, or service operations occurred.

For release, recovery, or deployment work, follow [`docs/agent/release-process.md`](docs/agent/release-process.md) and, for release/publication gates, [`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

## 6. Load relevant domain rules

- Public runtime and API surfaces: [`docs/agent/openapi-guidelines.md`](docs/agent/openapi-guidelines.md).
- Workflow Sessions and request identity: [`docs/agent/session-model.md`](docs/agent/session-model.md).
- Manual multi-window collaboration: [`docs/agent/manual-window-collaboration.md`](docs/agent/manual-window-collaboration.md).
- Durable Agent identity, Conversation/Wake, and asynchronous Agent work: [`docs/architecture/durable-agent-runtime.md`](docs/architecture/durable-agent-runtime.md).
- Current durable Agent/Conversation/Wake implementation contract: [`docs/architecture/durable-agent-conversation.md`](docs/architecture/durable-agent-conversation.md).
- Authority boundaries: [`docs/agent/permission-model.md`](docs/agent/permission-model.md).
- Architecture decisions: [`docs/agent/architecture-decisions.md`](docs/agent/architecture-decisions.md).

Use these as domain sources of truth rather than duplicating their detailed contracts here.
