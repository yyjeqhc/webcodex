# Documentation Index

[English](INDEX.md) | [简体中文](INDEX.zh-CN.md)

Start with the goal that matches what you are trying to do.

## I want to use WebCodex normally

- [README](../README.md) — what WebCodex does and the difference between full use and a temporary trial
- [Full Setup](PERSONAL_SETUP.md) — **recommended entry**: regular Server + Runner + projects + ChatGPT
- [AI-assisted setup](AI_ONBOARDING.md) — have an AI agent configure WebCodex using ordinary user language
- [MCP](MCP.md) — ChatGPT, Claude, and other MCP clients

## I only want to try it for a few minutes

- [Quick Trial](QUICK_START.md) — temporarily try one repository with one `webcodex share` command

## I need production deployment or deep troubleshooting

- [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) — systemd/Docker, multi-user self-hosting, and long-lived operations
- [Windows + OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel deep dive](WINDOWS_OPENAI_TUNNEL.md) — independent Windows Server/Runner, Tunnel setup, and real troubleshooting notes
- [Runner](RUNNER.md) — Runner operations reference
- [CLI](CLI.md) — full command, configuration, and credential reference

## I need authentication or network options

- [MCP](MCP.md) — Bearer, query-token fallback, OAuth, private tunnel, and MCP protocol reference
- [Authentication](AUTH_MODEL.md) — detailed credential and authority boundaries
- [Deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) — stable HTTPS origins, self-hosting, and production networking
- [GPT Actions](GPT_ACTIONS.md) — optional OpenAPI-based Custom GPT integration

## I need help

- [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) — installation, connection, runtime, and Runner problems
- [Security](../SECURITY.md) — safe operating guidance and security model

## I want to understand or extend WebCodex

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) — how the major components fit together
- [Coding Workflow](CODING_WORKFLOW.md) — task bootstrap, guidance, validation, and closeout
- [Computer Use roadmap](COMPUTER_USE.md) — semantic-first desktop automation direction and validation priorities

## I want to contribute or release WebCodex

The `docs/agent/` pages below are maintainer/internal contracts. They intentionally
contain protocol fields, compatibility names, and implementation invariants that
ordinary users should not need to learn.

- [Architecture decisions](agent/architecture-decisions.md)
- [Runtime host context](agent/runtime-host-context.md) — Runner-configured planning context and runtime diagnostics
- [Job reliability and Runner concurrency](agent/job-reliability-and-concurrency.md) — restart recovery, observation semantics, shared Job capacity, and tool-description requirements
- [Tool request tracing](agent/tool-request-tracing.md) — maintainer forensic payload/correlation contract
