# OpenAPI / GPT Action Guidelines

Product and integration detail for GPT Actions and OpenAPI exposure.
**Hard invariants agents must obey are in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)**
(architecture section). This document holds the longer product rules so
`AGENTS.md` stays an execution contract.

Related: [`GPT_ACTIONS.md`](../GPT_ACTIONS.md), [`MCP.md`](../MCP.md).

## 1. Surface synchronization

When adding or renaming a runtime tool, update **all** of:

1. `ToolCall` enum / parser  
2. `KNOWN_TOOL_NAMES`  
3. metadata  
4. registry schema  
5. OAuth runtime tool policy  
6. OpenAPI accepted names / examples  
7. MCP schema tests  
8. consistency tests  

Tool metadata, registry, OAuth scope policy, MCP `tools/list`, and OpenAPI
`callRuntimeTool` names must stay synchronized.

## 2. Exposure rules (invariants)

- Do **not** expose legacy `/api/codex` routes in GPT Action OpenAPI.
- Do **not** expose agent token management or pairing endpoints in GPT Action
  OpenAPI.
- WebCodex GPT Actions must stay **below the 30-operation GPT Actions limit**.
  Verify the current OpenAPI operation count through generation/tests rather
  than relying on any document for a fixed count. **Do not hard-code** a live
  operation total in agent rules.

---

## 3. Product labeling and discovery

- Prefer **non-consequential** labels for read-only, discovery, onboarding, and
  bounded local project setup actions.
- `registerProject` and `createProject` are **non-consequential** onboarding
  actions when constrained by agent policy, allowed roots, and non-overwrite
  defaults.
- Keep **destructive actions consequential**: shell/job execution, raw writes,
  patch application, delete/restore/discard, imports, and generic dispatch.
- `callRuntimeTool` is advanced/generic; use dedicated Actions only for stable
  common workflows that fit the operation budget.
- When adding future runtime tools, default to `callRuntimeTool` exposure unless
  there is an explicit product reason and operation-count budget for a dedicated
  Action.
- `listRuntimeTools` full detail discovery includes expanded schemas and may be
  too large for GPT Actions. Daily discovery should prefer
  `callRuntimeTool(tool="tool_manifest")`; focused `listRuntimeTools` calls
  should pass `summary_only=true` with `category`, `features`, or `limit`.
  Prefer `runtime_status` or the tool manifest for the current tool count; the
  response-size issue is expanded schema/metadata, not a fixed tool count.

---

## 4. Project smoke and capabilities

- `list_projects` project entries expose `capabilities`.
- Smoke selection should prefer `capabilities.recommended_for_smoke=true`.
- Git smoke must require `capabilities.git_available=true`.
- `agent:special:test-mcp` may be safe but not git-backed.

---

## 5. Artifact upload tools

Chunked artifact upload tools remain runtime-only through `callRuntimeTool`;
do not promote them to dedicated GPT Action operations:

- `artifact_upload_begin`
- `artifact_upload_chunk`
- `artifact_upload_finish`
- `artifact_upload_abort`

`artifact_upload_chunk`, `artifact_upload_finish`, and `artifact_upload_abort`
must repeat the exact `path` used by `artifact_upload_begin`. This binds
`upload_id` to the requested target artifact path.

Artifact smoke paths should use `artifacts/smoke/<name>.artifact` or
`artifacts/smoke/<name>.txt`. Verify abort cleanup with
`artifact_upload_abort.final_file_exists` or
`read_project_artifact_metadata(allow_missing=true)`, not with expected read
failures. `policy_rejected` means policy blocked the request before a write.

---

## 6. Flattened Action fields

- GPT Actions should prefer **flattened top-level fields** over `params` /
  `arguments`.
- Use `recording_session_id` for generic wrapper recorder metadata.
- Use `session_id` as tool business input.
- When a runtime-only tool is expected to work through GPT Action
  `callRuntimeTool` with flattened top-level fields, `ToolCallRequest.properties`
  must expose **every** flattened field that GPT Actions need (including nested
  object/list payload fields such as `edits`, `validation`, `labels`,
  `checkpoint_id`, `confirm`, `dry_run`, `include_untracked`, and
  `include_diff_stat`).
- Add/update tests that fail when flattened Action fields are missing.
- Do **not** loosen `additionalProperties` to `true` as a workaround — list the
  needed flattened fields explicitly.
