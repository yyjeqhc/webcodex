# Durable Agent runtime and asynchronous work

This document defines the standing product direction for durable Agent identity and
asynchronous work in WebPi. It builds on the implemented Agent/Conversation/Wake
foundation without turning WebPi into a generic swarm framework or workflow
scheduler.

Implementation details for the current communication and wake substrate live in
[`durable-agent-conversation.md`](durable-agent-conversation.md). Workflow Session
semantics remain defined by [`../agent/session-model.md`](../agent/session-model.md).

## Product direction

The product goal is a durable Agent entity that can outlive any one model turn,
browser window, host connection, Project, or execution carrier.

A user should eventually be able to:

1. create or select a durable Agent;
2. attach a current window/host to that Agent;
3. communicate through durable Conversations and Inbox Deliveries;
4. leave work for the Agent that remains durable while no model is running;
5. later attach another Endpoint and continue as the same Agent;
6. execute accepted work through whatever authorized carrier is appropriate;
7. inspect durable status instead of inferring progress from browser/UI state.

The model process is not the Agent. A model turn executes **on behalf of** a durable
Agent. Closing a window therefore means that an Endpoint disappeared; it does not
mean that the Agent, its Conversations, or its accepted work disappeared.

This direction may eventually make multi-Agent scheduling possible, but scheduling
is not the product definition. WebPi should first make Agent identity and work
independent from windows and synchronous model turns. Runnable-frontier scheduling,
capacity management, graph execution, and autonomous delegation remain optional
capabilities that require separate product evidence.

## Names that must not collapse

WebPi already contains several concepts that use similar words. They are separate
domains and must remain explicit in code, schemas, documentation, and reviews.

| Concept | Meaning | Not interchangeable with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime Project | Runner-registered execution target addressed as `agent:<client_id>:<project_id>` | durable Agent identity |
| Durable Agent | Server-minted `wc_dagent_*` identity representing who acts/communicates | Runner, browser window, credential, Workflow Session |
| Agent Endpoint | Current Host/Client attachment for one Agent, with lifecycle/generation | Agent identity or work ownership |
| Conversation | Durable communication space | Workflow Session, task queue, execution context |
| Agent Delivery | Recipient-specific Inbox state for one Message | model invocation or accepted work |
| Wake Intent | Durable logical processing opportunity for an Agent | Message, Delivery, Agent Task, execution lease |
| Agent Task | Durable unit of explicitly created/accepted asynchronous Agent work | Workflow Session todo, Conversation Message, Job |
| Agent TaskAttempt | Durable exact execution-ownership attempt for one Agent Task | Endpoint, Workflow Session, CodingAgentRun |
| Workflow Session | Existing execution/provenance/validation/handoff evidence context | Agent, Conversation, Agent Task |
| Job | Concrete long-running process/validation execution | Agent Task or TaskAttempt |
| CodingAgentRun | Existing ACP delegated coding execution | Agent Task itself |
| Goal | Server-owned high-level durable intent/control state (`wc_goal_*`) | Agent Task, Workflow Session, Job, Project authority, scheduler |

The `agent:` prefix in a runtime Project id is historical Runner-address syntax. It
is unrelated to the durable `wc_dagent_*` Agent identity domain.

In implementation names, use `AgentTask` / `AgentTaskAttempt` for the asynchronous Agent work domain. Ordinary coding work uses Workflow Session and Job terminology; do not introduce an unqualified new `Task` type where ownership would be ambiguous.

## Implemented durable Agent foundation

The current implementation already establishes these boundaries, the A2.5 natural-conversation path, and the A3 durable AgentTask/TaskAttempt ownership substrate:

```text
Durable Agent
    |
    +-- Agent Card / profile
    +-- Endpoint attachments + controller generations
    |     +-- process-local exact Host adapter binding
    +-- Conversations
    |     +-- append-only Messages
    |     +-- recipient Deliveries / Inbox
    |
    +-- Wake Intents
    |     +-- Endpoint/generation-bound Wake Delivery Attempts
    |     +-- bounded event-driven continuation scheduling
    |
    +-- Agent Tasks
          +-- explicit durable assignee
          +-- fenced, leased TaskAttempts + Attempt-local controller generation
```

Important current invariants:

- `agent_id` is Server-minted stable identity; Agent Card metadata grants no
  execution authority.
- Endpoint identity is replaceable and principal-bound; lease validity and
  controller generation fence stale attachments.
- Conversation participation grants communication authority only.
- Message, Delivery, Wake Intent, and Wake Delivery Attempt are independent durable
  facts.
- Message/Delivery creation and required Wake coalescing are transactional.
- communication-resource authorization hides existence from unauthorized exact-id
  probes.
- generic database open is storage-only; standalone Server takeover recovery runs
  only after explicit Server instance ownership is acquired.
- dispatch uncertainty after the Wake dispatch fence is preserved rather than
  blindly retried.
- one authenticated communication principal can create/select/update multiple
  durable Agents, explicitly attach different Host windows, and communicate through
  exact-recipient Conversations without making the window the Agent.
- exact Agent/Endpoint/generation bootstrap exposes only bounded IDs, counts,
  high-watermarks, Wake hints, and truthful current adapter capability; authoritative
  Inbox and Conversation reads remain separate. An already-active explicit turn can
  idempotently accept one pending Wake through an `explicit_activation` Attempt and
  recover the same consume token without pretending it requested a new model turn.
- bounded Agent listing exposes `production_auto_resume_available` only as the
  conjunction of the listed current durable Endpoint/generation state and a production
  Host carrier in this Server process. Together with `active_endpoint_count`, this lets
  a coordinator distinguish a current Endpoint without a carrier from no current
  Endpoint. It is not idle/model liveness, presence, capacity reservation, execution
  authority, or guaranteed/immediate Host scheduling; restart clears the process-local
  side until an ordinary fenced rebind/recovery succeeds.
- automatically resumed replies can derive stable replay identity from exact Wake
  plus a bounded operation index, closing the reply-committed/response-lost window
  without merging Wake and Delivery consumption.
- Agent Tasks are independent durable work truth with explicit assignment; Conversation
  Message/source references and Project references are correlation only.
- each execution-ownership retry creates a durable TaskAttempt with a distinct opaque
  Attempt fence; lease expiry never transfers assignment and cannot be revived by the
  same Agent.
- carrier replacement within one TaskAttempt increments an Attempt-local controller
  generation without creating another Attempt; older generations are stale.
- AgentTask creation, Attempt start, and terminal completion use durable keyed replay
  in the same authoritative SQLite transaction as their effects, and Task/Attempt,
  fence, generation, lease, terminal result, and accepted replay identity survive
  database reopen/Server restart.
- A3 does not bind or dispatch an execution backend: starting a TaskAttempt does not
  create a CodingAgentRun, Job, Workflow Session, Wake, or Host callback.
- process-local Host bindings are empty after restart; offline Messages, Deliveries,
  and the same logical Wake remain durable. A fresh/replacement exact Endpoint may
  register a carrier. An MCP App may recreate only its lost local binding when the
  exact v11 binding fingerprint still matches, or when the authenticated principal,
  current Endpoint/generation, and durable canonical ClientWindow all match. The
  latter permits a refreshed iframe to use a new process-instance binding fence
  without granting continuity to another Host window.
- project-scoped Memory is unchanged; Agent-scoped Memory is only a future boundary.
- durable Goals are independent high-level intent/control truth; Goal identity, ownership, lifecycle, revision, and correlations grant no Project, Runner, filesystem, Workflow Session, AgentTaskAttempt, CodingAgentRun, or Job authority.

G3 adds an optional production ChatGPT MCP App Host carrier on top of this substrate. It is deliberately a pull bridge rather than a fake Server callback: one explicit `present_agent_continuation(agent_id, endpoint_id, expected_controller_generation)` card binds the current `ui://webcodex/agent-continuation/v16` resource, while ModelHidden app-only operations establish one exact process-local View binding, renew the exact Endpoint, acquire through the existing Wake claim state machine, cross the existing durable dispatch fence, and record Host dispatch acceptance or uncertainty. The View itself performs `ui/message` only after prepare succeeds. The process-local `binding_id` fences the current iframe instance but grants no authority and is not durable execution truth. The Store retains its identity-bound SHA-256 fingerprint as the no-Window restart fallback plus an optional canonical hashed ClientWindow key as Host-window continuity; raw Host session metadata is never persisted. Natural Endpoint expiry is a separate bounded path: only the same authenticated principal + durable ClientWindow may ask the App-only recovery operation to atomically replace the exact expired generation with its immediate successor. v16 retains v15's independently idempotent predecessor recovery edges and at-most-eight exact `generation+1` successor hops; an old selector never skips directly to a later generation.

Every bridge operation re-runs ordinary communication authorization and exact Agent/Endpoint/controller-generation validation. Ordinary push bindings still require an Endpoint freshly attached in the current Server process. For MCP Apps, successful bind persists the current identity-bound recovery fingerprint and the optional canonical ClientWindow key already derived by the protocol adapter. Server takeover clears process-local bindings and `wake_capable` but preserves both. With no local binding, the exact fingerprint remains sufficient; when a canonical Window is present, the same principal + exact current Endpoint/generation + same Window may also receive the normal `success=true` recovery projection and create a new iframe fence after refresh. Exact unbind clears the current fingerprint but preserves a matching Window key; natural expiry also preserves only that Window key for the dedicated expired-Endpoint replacement operation. Explicit detach (including after expiry), ordinary Endpoint replacement, and push transition clear both recovery values. Replacement replay re-checks the successor's retained Window key, so a historical replay record cannot undo that revocation. Only a newly committed replacement populates `attached_endpoints`; replay and restart recovery never recreate fresh push-attachment authority. Missing or malformed Window metadata grants nothing beyond the exact fingerprint fallback, and another Window, stale generation, expiry, detach, foreign principal, malformed result, or generic bridge failure remains fail-closed. The strict published continuation projection schema still requires `recovery` on every result (`null` normally, the sole fixed restart-loss object when recoverable), so Host schema projection cannot discard the observation. Replacing or withdrawing a View reuses existing Wake reconciliation: a pre-fence claim is revoked and the logical Wake returns to `pending`, while a prepared/delivered Attempt becomes `delivery_unknown`. The App never blindly resends after the dispatch fence. Host `ui/message` success means only `dispatch_accepted`; only later exact `consume_agent_wake` proves that a continuation model turn actually ran. A consume-before-ACK race is valid and late ACK is idempotent. v16 keeps the slower bounded heartbeat cadence while hidden but allows the same acquire -> prepare -> `ui/message` -> finish path in background. Visibility transitions are scheduling observations only: they do not by themselves create `delivery_unknown`. Host scheduling remains best effort/non-immediate, and correctness still depends on the durable Wake and exact consume rather than timer liveness.

Runtime Console, explicit activation, and push `ContinuationAdapter` behavior retain their existing contracts. The MCP App is an optional carrier, not a scheduler or a source of Agent, Task, Goal, Project, Workflow Session, or execution authority. Ordinary WebPi Jobs are not materialized as MCP Tasks. See [`../agent/mcp-app-continuation-experiments.md`](../agent/mcp-app-continuation-experiments.md) for the Host evidence and production mapping.

These invariants, the natural-conversation slice, and the durable A3 ownership
substrate support asynchronous Agent work without introducing a scheduler.

## Durable Goal Phase 1

Phase 1 adds a deliberately small, Control-owned Goal domain. A Goal answers:

> What does the user ultimately want completed, and what is the authoritative high-level durable state of that intent?

It does **not** answer who owns the next execution attempt, which repository operation should run, or whether a concrete coding Session/Job succeeded. Those remain owned by AgentTask/TaskAttempt, Workflow Session, Project/Runner, and Job domains respectively.

The authoritative model is persisted in the existing Server SQLite database using independent `wc_goals`, `wc_goal_correlations`, and `wc_goal_idempotency` tables. The first model is intentionally bounded:

```text
Goal
  goal_id                 # Server-minted wc_goal_*
  owner principal         # stable authorized communication-management principal
  title                   # <= 200 characters
  objective               # <= 8192 UTF-8 bytes
  controller_agent_id?    # exact owned wc_dagent_* used only for Goal attention routing
  lifecycle               # active | completed | cancelled
  revision                # monotonic, starts at 1
  created_at / updated_at
  terminal_at?
  terminal_reason?        # <= 4096 UTF-8 bytes
  correlations[]          # <= 64 explicit AgentTask / Workflow Session identities
```

`active`, `completed`, and `cancelled` are the complete Phase 1 authoritative lifecycle. Terminal state is immutable. Presentation phases such as `implementing`, `blocked`, or `waiting_validation` are not stored as Goal lifecycle. Unknown persisted lifecycle/correlation values fail closed rather than becoming a new state implicitly.

The optional controller is deliberately separate from the worker that executes a concrete AgentTask. The Task worker remains the Task/Attempt assignee; the Goal controller is the durable Agent identity that should receive the Goal's next reasoning opportunity when correlated work terminalizes. They may be the same Agent or different Agents. `controller_agent_id` is set only from an explicit exact `wc_dagent_*` input and is re-authorized against the Goal owner's communication principal on every create/set operation; it is never inferred from ClientWindow, Endpoint, Conversation, Project, Workflow Session, Task assignee, or recent activity. The controller field is routing identity only: it grants no Goal, AgentTask/TaskAttempt, Project/Runner/filesystem, Workflow Session, Job, CodingAgentRun, Endpoint, or Host authority.

Goal tools are Control-side only: `create_goal`, `get_goal`, `list_goals`, `update_goal`, `associate_goal_agent_task`, and `associate_goal_workflow_session`. They do not declare Project requirements or Runner capabilities. Reads use the existing stable communication-read principal model; mutations use communication management. Exact Goal reads combine id and owner in the durable lookup so a foreign id is indistinguishable from a nonexistent id. A supplied controller Agent is independently looked up under that same owner; foreign and nonexistent Agent ids share the same existence-hidden rejection. Create/update/association use durable keyed replay; exact duplicate retries replay, while changed reuse of the same key fails closed. Controller-less requests preserve the original Phase 1 idempotency hash shape so pre-upgrade replay remains valid. `list_goals` returns bounded summaries rather than objective text, controller identity, or correlation identities; exact `get_goal` returns the optional controller identity.

Correlation is explicit durable identity only:

- Goal → AgentTask association first re-authorizes the exact AgentTask under its existing owner-principal rules.
- Goal → Workflow Session association first runs the existing exact Session authority fence, including creation-time authority fingerprint validation and normal authorization for any bound Project.
- the Goal store then persists only the target identity and timestamp; it never persists the target's fence, token, authority, ledger, Job state, or other private execution data;
- Jobs remain traceable through their existing Workflow Session/AgentTask provenance. Phase 1 intentionally does not duplicate a Goal → Job truth.

A Goal reference never becomes inherited authority. A Goal that references a Project indirectly through an AgentTask still has no Project authority; a Goal that references a Session is not a Session credential; a Goal linked to an AgentTask does not own that TaskAttempt; and a Goal controller Agent id does not become a Goal/Task credential. Any later dereference must run the target domain's normal checks again.

No current execution path accepts or requires `goal_id`: `work_on_project`, read/edit/search, shell/process, Job handoff/observation, validation, Git, and `finish_coding_task` retain their existing semantics. Goal is not selected from ClientWindow, OpenAI/MCP session data, Project identity, credential, Conversation, or Workflow Session. The historical Runner/Codex metadata field named `goal_id` remains compatibility metadata and is **not** the `wc_goal_*` durable identity.

Lifecycle remains independent across domains. `finish_coding_task` reports/finishes one Workflow Session concern and does not complete a Goal. AgentTask/TaskAttempt terminal completion likewise never transitions Goal lifecycle/revision/objective/terminal reason. The terminal-attention bridge described below records a fact and creates a bounded reasoning opportunity only; Goal progression remains an explicit `update_goal` or other ordinary authorized model decision. There is still no Goal scheduler, automatic next AgentTask, automatic TaskAttempt, Workflow Session, CodingAgentRun, Runner request, process, or Job.

### G2 — Goal Plan MCP App presentation

G2 is implemented as a projection over the exact durable Goal rather than a second state machine:

```text
authoritative Goal Store
        ↓
exact owner-authorized Goal read
        ↓
bounded Goal Plan projection
        ↓
present_goal_plan(goal_id)   # model-visible, App-bound, read-only
        ↓
ui://webcodex/goal-plan/v2
        ↓
goal_plan_state(goal_id)     # ModelHidden, App-only exact polling read
```

`present_goal_plan` is the only Goal tool bound to the Goal Plan App resource. Each explicit presentation call may create a new Host card; Goal mutations, AgentTask changes, Workflow Session changes, validation, Jobs, and `finish_coding_task` do not create or refresh cards. Ordinary coding/execution tools keep their native Host presentation.

The projection is intentionally sparse: exact `goal_id`, bounded title/objective, optional exact `controller_agent_id`, authoritative `active | completed | cancelled` lifecycle, monotonic revision, `updated_at`, optional terminal timestamp, bounded AgentTask/Workflow Session correlation counts, and an optional **derived** ClientWindow activity observation. Controller presentation is only the durable routing identity; no Endpoint id, controller generation, ClientWindow/private binding, or Host attachment is projected. The card otherwise exposes no correlation identities, raw Host `_meta`, Session ledger, TaskAttempt fence, authority fingerprint, Wake/consume token, credential, tool arguments/outputs, Job log, stdout, or stderr. G2 does not synthesize `implementing`, `blocked`, `validating`, `reviewing`, or any other durable lifecycle phase when the current durable facts do not prove one.

`goal_plan_state` is globally ModelHidden. A UI-capable Stateless MCP 2026 request advertises it to the Host with MCP Apps `ui.visibility = ["app"]`; it is not part of the ordinary model tool universe, Adaptive gateway targets, REST runtime surface, or legacy MCP surface. The protocol/App capability gate is not Goal authority: every polling call still derives the existing stable communication principal and independently performs the exact owner-scoped Goal read. App/iframe possession, ClientWindow, Project, Workflow Session, Conversation, credential transport state, and correlation do not select or authorize a Goal. Goal Plan polling and the Agent-continuation App controller operations remain ordinary Window-seen evidence, but are classified as non-meaningful activity so a live card cannot manufacture business progress.

For an **active** Goal, ClientWindow liveness is observational evidence only. The direction is exact authorized Goal → explicit Goal/Workflow Session correlations → re-authorized Session/Project → historically linked same-principal Window candidates → currently caller-visible Window-wide activity. The raw Window-wide timestamps returned while discovering Session-linked candidates are never projected directly; each event and in-flight request is re-filtered through current Project visibility first. `runtime:read` is required to expose the observation, and Project-scoped evidence still needs ordinary Project visibility, but Goal read itself keeps its existing communication-read requirement. Without runtime observability authority, Goal Plan remains usable with `activity.available=false` and no Window count or timestamps. This chain is never reversible: Window, Project, Session, credential, or timing cannot select a Goal.

The soft heuristic uses a fixed five-minute attention horizon. A caller-visible meaningful request currently in flight keeps the observation `active` even if it has run for hours. Otherwise the latest visible meaningful WebPi completion at or within five minutes is `active`; older known meaningful activity becomes `attention_needed` only when bounded coverage is sufficient. No correlated Window evidence is `unobserved`, not failure. Terminal Goals are `not_applicable` and never show inactivity warning. `last_seen` intentionally includes non-meaningful Host/App controller traffic while `last_meaningful_activity` excludes it, so a recently observed card can still report that business activity has been quiet. Session, Window, event, Project-visibility, and active-request scans are bounded; partial evidence never produces `attention_needed`.

No meaningful WebPi activity for five minutes is **not** proof that a model turn failed. The interval may contain Host scheduling, model inference, user interaction, work through GitHub or other connectors, Web/network delay, or a genuinely stalled turn. The projection is therefore a human-attention signal only: it does not heartbeat/extend/expire a TaskAttempt, create a Wake or successor Attempt, resume a model, terminalize a Task, mutate Goal lifecycle/revision, or grant execution authority. TaskAttempt correctness leases remain a separate hard fencing mechanism.

The App receives exact `goal_id` and revision in the initial presentation result and polls the authoritative Store by that id after successful Host initialization. Derived activity is live state rather than Goal revision truth, so the card may refresh `active → attention_needed → active` while the authoritative Goal revision remains unchanged; this never mutates `wc_goals`. Early results can render while initialization is pending. Active cards converge again after foreground/visibility changes; terminal Goals stop polling and retain a stable terminal presentation even if an older active notification arrives later. Teardown/page unload stops timers. Refresh/reopen requires no localStorage or Server process-local Goal map: the rebuilt View can recover current state from the exact durable identity and SQLite truth. Multiple Views observing the same Goal are safe because both presentation tools are pure reads.

There is no stable Goal page in the Web UI yet, so G2 deliberately omits an `Open in WebPi` link rather than emitting a dead or semantically incorrect URL.

**G3 — production Host continuation adapter.** G3 is now implemented for explicit Durable Agent Endpoints, independently of Goal. The public `present_agent_continuation` entry requires exact `agent_id`, `endpoint_id`, and `expected_controller_generation`; it does not infer a target from Goal, Workflow Session, Project, ClientWindow, credential, recent Agent, recent Task, or any other ambient state. The associated App bridge is available only on an App-enabled Stateless MCP 2026 request, where its hidden tools are projected with `ui.visibility = ["app"]`; they remain absent from the ordinary model universe, legacy MCP, REST/generic runtime, and Adaptive gateway targets, with a kernel protocol-capability gate as the final backstop.

The durable lifecycle remains exactly the pre-existing Agent Endpoint / Wake / Wake Delivery Attempt lifecycle. The App View is only a live Host controller/carrier: `bind` establishes one current process-local View fence, `state` heartbeats and renews the exact Endpoint, `wake_acquire` delegates to the existing claim path, `wake_prepare` crosses the existing durable dispatch fence and revalidates exact binding, and `wake_finish` records only accepted/unknown Host dispatch outcome. Claim fence and binding secret are not durable/model-visible truth; the automatic message carries the exact consume token only through App-private MCP result metadata, not ordinary structured model content or audit/trace payloads. `dispatch_prepared`, `dispatch_accepted`, and `dispatch_unknown` are bounded Host observations, not new authoritative Wake states. Only exact durable `consume_agent_wake` establishes `continuation_consumed`.

G3 by itself remains independent of Goal identity: presenting/binding a continuation card never selects a Goal. The first explicit Goal-to-carrier bridge is instead the narrow terminal-attention path below. Goal remains `active | completed | cancelled` high-level Control truth and `present_goal_plan` remains read-only presentation. No Goal revision/completion or next AgentTask is inferred from Host state, ClientWindow, credential, Project, Workflow Session, or ambient activity. These boundaries follow the [September 11–13, 2026 MCP App continuation findings](../agent/mcp-app-continuation-experiments.md): one sparse card converges from authoritative state, Host acceptance is not model resumption, and background Host scheduling is not an immediate guarantee.

The View starts binding only after successful Host initialization. Visibility selects only the bounded poll cadence; both foreground and hidden Views may continue the exact acquire/prepare/dispatch path. A visible/hidden transition while acquire, prepare, or Host dispatch is in flight neither cancels that path nor creates uncertainty. State refresh follows the current unresolved Wake after exact consumption, and never copies an older Attempt's dispatch phase onto its successor. The previous claim remains available for late ACK reconciliation until acquire takes the next Wake. The View finishes any pending ACK retry before acquiring a successor and retains only one Attempt's retry markers.

### Goal-correlated terminal attention

The first asynchronous Goal orchestration loop is deliberately narrower than a generic event system. When and only when the exact current `AgentTaskAttempt` successfully terminalizes, the same authoritative SQLite transaction checks every caller-owned **active** Goal currently correlated to that Task. For each such Goal it resolves the routing target from that Goal's explicit `controller_agent_id`; when the field is absent on an existing/legacy Goal, v1 uses the Task's current explicit assignee as the bounded backward-compatible fallback. The exact selected target Agent is re-checked as owned by the same principal before the transaction may persist exactly one `agent_task_terminal` attention Event and one pending `attention_event` Wake. `(kind, goal_id, task_attempt_id)` is unique, and the existing completion idempotency record is committed in the same transaction, so a crash cannot leave the Task terminal without a required attention fact and exact completion replay cannot fan out duplicates. A failed routing authorization or Event/Wake insert rolls the Task/Attempt terminal transition back too.

The Event is a durable semantic fact, not an authority snapshot or pub/sub payload. It stores only exact owner/selected target Agent identity, `goal_id`, `task_id`, `task_attempt_id`, terminal Task state, kind, and creation time. It deliberately omits Goal objective, Task instruction/result/error bodies, Session transcript, Project/Runner credentials, Attempt fence, Endpoint id/controller generation/private Host binding, and arbitrary JSON. The selected target is historical routing truth: changing `controller_agent_id` later does not retarget or duplicate an already-created Event/Wake, and the old Wake still grants no source-domain authority. Multiple active Goal correlations produce one bounded deterministic Event/Wake per Goal; new correlations are rejected once the same owner already has `MAX_GOAL_CORRELATIONS` (currently 64) active Goals pointing at that exact AgentTask, so a newly admitted Task cannot accumulate an unbounded terminal-attention fan-out. A terminal Goal is excluded at Event creation, while a Goal that becomes terminal afterward does not invalidate or retarget the historical Event.

The `attention_event` Wake is a third source beside `inbox_changed` and `agent_task_attempt`. It references only `source_event_id`; bootstrap derives bounded exact `event_id`, `goal_id`, `task_id`, and `task_attempt_id` after re-authorizing and validating the Event against authoritative Goal/Task/Attempt rows. Unlike `agent_task_attempt`, attention originates **after** the Attempt is terminal, so it never requires an active Attempt lease, Attempt heartbeat, or Attempt controller takeover. It still uses the normal Agent Endpoint/generation/binding/claim/prepare/dispatch fences and shares the global one-dispatched-Wake-per-Agent bound with every other Wake source. Missing Host/Endpoint capacity leaves the durable Wake pending and does not fail Task completion; `schedule_agent` is only a process-local best-effort hint.

The resumed automatic message is source-specific: it tells the model to bootstrap and exact-consume this Wake, then independently call normal `get_goal(goal_id)` and `read_agent_task(task_id)` before deciding what to do. Event/Wake identity grants no Goal, Task, Project, Runner, filesystem, Conversation, or Workflow Session authority. If another turn has already completed/cancelled the Goal, the resumed turn observes that terminal truth and no-ops rather than reopening it. If the Goal is still active, the model may explicitly update/complete/cancel it, create and associate a next AgentTask, associate a relevant Workflow Session, or report/wait on a real blocker. The Server never auto-completes the Goal and never auto-generates the next Task.

## Asynchronous Agent work

An **Agent Task** represents durable work that has been explicitly accepted or
created for later completion. It answers:

> What work remains to be completed?

It must survive model-turn completion, Endpoint detach, browser closure, Server
restart, and temporary absence of an execution carrier.

An Agent Task is not created merely because a Conversation Message exists. A Message
is communication; converting or accepting a request into work must be an explicit
durable transition. An Agent Task may retain stable origin references such as `conversation_id` and
`source_message_id`, but the Message body remains owned by the Conversation domain.

A3 does not define a global work-stealing queue. Before an Agent Task can create an
Attempt, it has an explicit current assignee Agent established by Task creation,
acceptance, or a separate authorized reassignment transition. An unassigned Task may
exist if a real UI/workflow needs it, but it is not claimable by arbitrary Agents.
Changing the assignee is an explicit durable mutation; lease expiry alone never
silently transfers work to a different Agent.

Likewise, an Agent Task that references a Project does not receive Project authority.
The Project reference identifies where work may need to occur; every actual execution
still passes the normal Project/Runner/filesystem/permission checks.

A first Agent Task model should stay deliberately small. Candidate durable fields
are:

```text
AgentTask
  task_id
  creator / owner principal attribution
  assignee_agent_id?  # must be explicit before creating an Attempt
  bounded title / instruction
  source_conversation_id?
  source_message_id?
  referenced_project_id?
  state
  created_at
  updated_at
  terminal result / reason references?
```

The exact state enum should be chosen by the implementing slice, not expanded in
advance for hypothetical graph execution. The first slice needs only enough states
to distinguish available/active work from terminal success/failure and any explicit
cancellation that is actually required.

## TaskAttempt is the execution ownership unit

An Agent Task does not record a mutable `claimed_by` field that is repeatedly reused
across retries. Each concrete attempt is a separate durable **Agent TaskAttempt**.

```text
AgentTask
   |
   +-- TaskAttempt 1 -> expired / failed
   +-- TaskAttempt 2 -> failed
   +-- TaskAttempt 3 -> completed
```

A TaskAttempt answers:

> Who owns this exact execution attempt, and which generation of that attempt is
> still allowed to make progress?

Candidate durable fields are:

```text
AgentTaskAttempt
  attempt_id
  task_id
  attempt_number
  assignee_agent_id
  state
  lease_expires_at
  attempt_fence
  attempt_controller_generation
  workflow_session_id?
  execution_kind?
  execution_ref?
  created_at
  started_at?
  terminal_at?
```

The Attempt belongs to the durable Agent named by the Agent Task's current explicit
assignment, not to a browser window. An Endpoint or other execution carrier is only
a current way of executing that Attempt.

### Two different stale-execution fences

Attempt retry and carrier replacement are different events and need different
fences.

**Attempt fence** separates one TaskAttempt from a later TaskAttempt:

```text
Attempt 1 (fence A) -> lease expires
Attempt 2 (fence B) -> becomes current

late heartbeat(A) -> stale
late complete(A)  -> stale
late fail(A)      -> stale
```

The same Agent reclaiming work after Attempt 1 expires creates Attempt 2. Matching
`agent_id` must never revive an expired Attempt.

**Attempt controller generation** separates execution carriers inside the same Attempt:

```text
Attempt 2
  Agent A
  attempt_fence = B
  attempt_controller_generation = 4
       |
       +-- old carrier binding / attempt generation 3 -> stale
       +-- replacement carrier binding / attempt generation 4 -> current
```

Carrier replacement therefore does not necessarily create a new Attempt, but the
old carrier must lose the ability to heartbeat, dispatch, or submit a terminal
result. `attempt_controller_generation` is Attempt-local freshness metadata, not a
credential or a grant of Project authority. It is distinct from the existing Agent
Endpoint controller generation. When the carrier is an Agent Endpoint, the binding
must also preserve and validate the exact `endpoint_id` plus that Endpoint's own
controller generation.

If an execution backend already has a stronger exact identity (for example a
CodingAgentRun `run_id` plus provider-instance fencing), bind and revalidate that
identity rather than weakening it into a generic controller token.

## Attempt authority and lease semantics

Possession of an Attempt id, fence, lease timestamp, Agent id, or Attempt controller
generation is never sufficient authority by itself.

The intended admission rule is conceptually:

```text
normal caller authorization
+ authorized Agent Task visibility / operation
+ exact active task_id + attempt_id
+ exact assignee_agent_id
+ unexpired Attempt lease
+ exact opaque attempt_fence
+ current attempt_controller_generation when a replaceable carrier is bound
+ normal Project / executor authority for consequential execution
```

`attempt_fence` is conflict-detection/freshness metadata, not a bearer credential.
A lease that is already expired cannot be renewed by the stale owner and cannot
submit completion. A new authorized start/claim by the current assignee after expiry
creates a new Attempt.

Planner or scheduler output, if one is added later, is advisory. In A3, assignment
is explicit rather than selected by a scheduler. The authoritative Attempt
start/claim and dispatch mutations must re-check current Agent Task state, current
assignee, Attempt state, lease, Project/executor authority, and any dependency rules
that eventually exist.

## Idempotency, replay, and uncertainty

Agent Task mutations should follow the existing WebPi durable patterns:

- create-like operations use caller-generated idempotency keys plus canonical
  request fingerprints;
- exact uncertain retry returns the original Agent Task/TaskAttempt/result;
- reusing one key for changed intent fails closed;
- duplicate terminal completion is exact replay, not a second side effect;
- expired Attempt heartbeat/completion is rejected even when the Agent is the same;
- once a later Attempt exists, an older Attempt remains permanently stale;
- restart restores durable Task/Attempt truth rather than inferring ownership from
  process-local state.

Execution dispatch has a separate uncertainty boundary. If a backend dispatch may
have happened, the TaskAttempt must preserve that ambiguity and reconcile the exact
execution rather than minting a replacement execution blindly. Existing
CodingAgentRun `outcome_unknown` / provider-instance semantics are the preferred
first backend precedent.

## Communication, Wake, Task, and execution are separate

The expected relationship is:

```text
Human / Agent
    |
    v
Conversation Message
    |
    | explicit accept/create work
    v
Agent Task
    |
    | exact claim
    v
Agent TaskAttempt
    |
    +--> CodingAgentRun
    |       or
    +--> Agent Endpoint continuation
    |       or future concrete backend
    v
Workflow Session / Job / backend execution evidence
    |
    v
exact Attempt terminal transition
    |
    v
Agent Task result
    |
    v
Conversation reply / durable notification
```

The arrows are correlations, not authority inheritance.

A Wake Intent says that an Agent should receive another processing opportunity. It
is not an Agent Task claim and does not mean work completed. Consuming a Wake does
not consume Agent Task work. Consuming Inbox Deliveries does not complete an Agent
Task. An Agent Task may remain durable while the Agent has no wake-capable Endpoint.

A Workflow Session remains the execution/provenance/validation context for concrete
work. It does not become the Agent Task identity. A Session todo remains a useful
manual coordinator/worker assignment primitive, but it is not silently upgraded
into an Agent Task.

## Authority and privacy boundaries

Agent entity work crosses communication and execution domains, so the boundary must
remain explicit from the first Agent Task slice.

Standing rules:

- Agent identity or Agent Card metadata grants no execution authority.
- Conversation membership, authorship, mention, Delivery, or Wake possession grants
  no Agent Task execution authority.
- Agent Task assignment grants no Project, Runner, filesystem, Job, Workflow
  Session, Computer, or CodingAgent authority.
- An Agent Task's Project reference grants no access to that Project.
- Claim/dispatch/completion re-authorize their owning Agent Task domain and any
  actual Project/executor target at the consequential boundary.
- Agent Task visibility, Agent Task management, assignment/claim, and underlying execution
  authority are conceptually distinct even if the first implementation can safely
  reuse a smaller closed scope set.
- exact Task/Attempt lookups should follow the existing authorization-result privacy
  discipline: an unauthorized caller must not use guessed opaque ids as an
  existence oracle.
- generic audit/telemetry should keep ids, state, counts, generations, and bounded
  metadata, not duplicate full Agent Task instructions, Conversation bodies, secrets, or
  opaque fences/tokens.

Do not name new scopes merely to make the model look symmetric. Introduce a scope
only when the actual first Agent Task surface creates a distinct authority audience.

For the first A3 slice, Agent assignment must not manufacture a new bearer
principal. Task creation/assignment/start/heartbeat/completion run under the current
authenticated caller and must prove that caller may operate the exact Task and its
current assignee Agent in the Task domain. A simple first implementation may reuse
the Agent's existing owner communication principal when that is the actual product
audience, but doing so does not confer Project or executor authority and does not
make `agent_id`, `task_id`, `attempt_id`, or an opaque fence a credential.

Execution-carrier admission is then additive rather than implicit. A
CodingAgentRun-backed Attempt does not require any browser/Host Endpoint; it
re-authorizes the exact Project and CodingAgent backend under their normal rules. An
Endpoint-backed Attempt additionally requires the exact currently authorized
Endpoint plus its generation/binding fences. This keeps Task ownership independent
from window presence while preventing either Agent ownership or Endpoint possession
from silently broadening execution authority.

## Agent continuity across windows

The durable identity model is intentionally stronger than window continuity:

```text
Window / Host Endpoint E1 disappears
        |
        v
Durable Agent still exists
        |
        +-- Agent Card
        +-- Conversation / Inbox / Wake
        +-- future Agent Memory
        +-- Agent Tasks / TaskAttempts
        |
        v
Endpoint E2 attaches later
```

A replacement Endpoint may continue the same Agent, subject to current principal
ownership, Endpoint generation, TaskAttempt controller fencing, and the execution
backend's own rules. No model is assumed to remain resident between turns.

This also leaves a clean future boundary for Agent-scoped Memory and Skills. Current
Project Memory remains unchanged until a deliberate migration/namespace design is
implemented. Agent Skills are later additive capability/configuration, not part of
TaskAttempt authority.

## Execution backend sequence

Do not build a universal execution-provider framework in the Agent Task foundation.
Use concrete backends first.

### A3 — Agent Task + fenced TaskAttempt

A3 is implemented and establishes the durable work/ownership substrate:

- explicit work creation;
- explicit assignment/acceptance and atomic Attempt start/claim by that assignee;
- lease + exact Attempt fencing;
- carrier/controller-generation fencing where needed;
- exact heartbeat/completion/replay;
- restart recovery;
- authority/privacy boundaries;
- minimal observation/listing needed to dogfood the domain.

A3 does **not** automatically choose an assignee, spawn workers, operate a global
claimable queue, or choose execution capacity.

### A4a — TaskAttempt -> existing CodingAgentRun (implemented)

A4a is implemented through `start_agent_task_coding_run` and
`reconcile_agent_task_coding_run`. The runtime re-authorizes the exact TaskAttempt,
Project, and CodingAgent backend; persists the prepared binding in
`wc_agent_task_coding_runs`; durably claims dispatch before starting the backend;
preserves uncertain dispatch as `outcome_unknown`; and reconciles the authoritative
CodingAgentRun before terminalizing the exact TaskAttempt. The binding retains the
run/provider/authority/intent identities needed to reject a changed or stale backend
rather than weakening them into generic Task controller state.

This first concrete backend proves that Agent Task execution is independent from
ChatGPT browser windows and that TaskAttempt ownership can survive Server restart and
backend-response uncertainty.

### A4b — TaskAttempt -> Agent Endpoint continuation (implemented)

A4b is implemented through `start_agent_task_endpoint_continuation`. The model supplies
only the exact `task_id`, `attempt_id`, `assignee_agent_id`, `attempt_fence`, and
`attempt_controller_generation`; startup never selects an Endpoint. The Store records
one concrete `wc_agent_task_endpoint_executions` row plus one durable
`agent_task_attempt` Wake. Its Endpoint id/generation are nullable until an existing
wake-capable carrier later claims the Wake. Attempt controller generation remains
authoritative only in `wc_agent_task_attempts`; the backend row does not duplicate it.
A4a and A4b are mutually exclusive per Attempt rather than hidden behind a universal
execution-provider abstraction.

Task-origin Wakes are a second explicit Wake source, not fabricated Inbox activity.
They carry exact Task/Attempt references while Conversation Message/Delivery ids and
Inbox high-watermarks stay null. The Host continuation envelope re-reads durable Task
truth and carries the exact current Attempt fence/generation. Wake consumption proves
one reasoning takeover only; exact AgentTask completion remains a separate mutation.

A4b intentionally separates a short pre-takeover lease from renewable bounded active-turn reservations:

```text
TaskAttempt start
  -> short 60-second pre-takeover lease
Endpoint carrier claim / prepare / Host dispatch
  -> still short pre-takeover semantics
exact model turn bootstrap + first exact consume
  -> bounded 30-minute active-turn reservation
ordinary coding work
  -> no periodic 60-second heartbeat ceremony
exact active-turn proof heartbeat before reservation expiry, when needed
  -> another bounded 30-minute active-turn reservation
  -> repeat only while the same exact Attempt/turn proof remains current
exact TaskAttempt completion
  -> terminal Task -> correlated attention_event Wake when applicable
abnormal/stalled model turn
  -> takeover lease eventually expires -> old Attempt permanently stale
  -> a new Attempt requires an explicit authorized start
```

The first successful exact consume of an `agent_task_attempt` Wake promotes only the
same latest, active, unexpired, exact-assignee Attempt whose durable A4b Endpoint
execution still matches that Wake and Endpoint generation. Promotion is atomic with
Wake consumption and uses `max(existing_lease, now + 30 minutes)`. Consume replay does
not slide the lease. An expired, terminal, superseded, or carrier-mismatched Attempt is
never revived; its already-dispatched Wake can still be consumed/ACKed without lease
promotion. `inbox_changed` and `attention_event` consumption never changes a TaskAttempt
lease.

`heartbeat_agent_task_attempt` has two intentionally distinct modes. Without active-turn
proof it preserves the ordinary A3/pre-takeover behavior: exact current Attempt fencing
plus `max(existing_lease, now + 60 seconds)`. After actual A4b model takeover, the same
turn may additionally provide the exact consumed Task-origin `wake_id` and its
`consume_token`. In the same authoritative transaction the Server still rechecks normal
Task ownership, latest Attempt identity, assignee, fence, current Attempt controller
generation, active/unexpired state, the consumed Wake/token hash, and its durable A4b
Endpoint execution binding. Only then may the heartbeat use
`max(existing_lease, now + 30 minutes)`. Duration and absolute expiry remain
Server-authoritative; one renewal never grants a multi-hour lease, but repeated exact
renewals before expiry can support a multi-hour online turn through successive bounded
30-minute reservations. The proof is model-turn lineage evidence, not Task, Project,
Runner, Goal, Session, or Endpoint authority.

This renewal depends only on durable Store truth, so a Server restart does not break an
otherwise-current proof. Conversely, Endpoint loss/replacement advances the Attempt
controller generation and clears the old carrier binding, so a stale model turn cannot
renew even if it still knows the old Wake token. Expired, terminal, or superseded
Attempts are never revived. Renewal occurs only through this explicit heartbeat
mutation: consume replay, MCP App polling, Endpoint heartbeat, ClientWindow activity,
Goal soft liveness, and ordinary model tool traffic never renew a TaskAttempt. The Goal
/ ClientWindow five-minute liveness signal remains diagnostics/human-attention evidence
only and is not a correctness lease input.

A4b lifecycle v1 intentionally closes here. Automatic renewal would require a truthful,
exact model-turn lifetime signal that proves this specific resumed turn is still running
and eventually identifies its end. The current ChatGPT/MCP App carrier contract does not
provide one: `ui/message` acceptance proves only Host delivery, View/App/Endpoint
liveness proves only carrier coordination, and exact `consume_agent_wake` proves a model
turn took over at least once but not that it remains alive minutes later. None of those
signals may be promoted into TaskAttempt renewal authority. If a future Host contract
exposes exact turn identity plus trustworthy running/end lifecycle, a bounded
process-local controller may use the existing explicit active-turn heartbeat while that
proof remains live. Until then, long A4b turns explicitly renew before expiry; Server
restart safely restores durable lease truth without reconstructing process-local turn
ownership or persisting the raw consume token.

Claiming a Task-origin Wake atomically installs the actual Endpoint carrier and advances
`attempt_controller_generation`. Releasing or losing that carrier before the dispatch
fence clears the backend carrier; a replacement carrier must claim again and therefore
advances the Attempt generation again. Older carrier turns are permanently stale.
Endpoint lease and TaskAttempt lease remain independent correctness boundaries; MCP App
Endpoint heartbeats do not extend the TaskAttempt takeover lease.

If no wake-capable Endpoint exists, startup still succeeds with a pending durable Wake
and a null carrier. The existing event-driven continuation controller is scheduled once
and later Endpoint registration schedules the Agent again; there is no busy wait, fake
Message/Delivery, implicit Task failure, or lease extension. If the TaskAttempt expires
before exact model takeover, claim/other authoritative mutation paths retire the
pre-fence Task Wake when still possible, the old Attempt remains stale, and the existing
Task retry/Ready semantics require an explicit new Attempt. A post-fence
`delivery_unknown` observation remains exactly consumable and is never blindly
re-dispatched.

The same delivery closes repeated Endpoint-successor recovery in App protocol v15.
Every durable recovery edge remains exactly one generation (`E1 -> E2`, `E2 -> E3`,
...), and replay of E1 may reveal only its recorded E2 even when a later generation is
current. If that exact E2 is naturally expired, the Server returns a successful strict
intermediate proof without bootstrapping it; the App adopts E2 and requests the next
one-hop recovery. The App validates every edge and stops after eight hops. Ordinary
replacement, push takeover, detach, different ClientWindow/principal, stale binding,
and generic JSON-RPC `-32000` still fail closed.

Only after A4a and A4b reveal repeated common machinery should WebPi consider a
minimal shared execution binding/adapter abstraction.

## Asynchronous events and scheduling are derived capabilities

A4b should not introduce a generic event bus, Goal scheduler, DAG engine, or autonomous
loop. The next architectural step after concrete Endpoint-backed work may be a small
durable event/attention layer driven by real domain transitions such as TaskAttempt
terminal/attention state, timers, or external completion signals.

Keep the meanings separate:

```text
Event = a durable fact that something happened
Wake  = a durable opportunity for one Agent to reason again
Wait  = one explicit durable one-shot interest in future source facts
Task  = durable work that may still be incomplete
Goal  = durable high-level intent/control truth
```

An Event is therefore not automatically a Wake, and a Wake is not an Event log. Many
durable events may coalesce into one reasoning opportunity; the resumed model reads
the authoritative source domains rather than treating copied event payloads as
execution truth. Event identity/reference must not transfer the source domain's
authority.

### Durable Agent Wait v1

`AgentWait` is the small model-facing rendezvous built on that distinction. It is not a
Task, Goal, Event log, Conversation, Workflow Session, or Host binding, and it never owns
or inherits authority over its sources. A Wait durably records only the caller-owned
target Agent, its bounded source selectors, and bounded semantic match references. The
Endpoint/generation supplied at creation is re-authorized only as the current Host
presentation/carrier selector and is not persisted as Wait execution ownership.

Wait v1 is deliberately one-shot with lifecycle
`waiting -> triggered -> resumed` or `waiting|triggered -> cancelled`. It supports only
1..8 exact `agent_task_terminal` selectors with fixed ANY semantics. Registration and the
current authoritative Task terminal snapshot occur in one SQLite IMMEDIATE transaction,
and both explicit TaskAttempt completion and CodingAgentRun terminal reconciliation write
matching Wait facts in their same source-terminal transaction. Admission bounds active
Waits per Agent and active Waits per source before terminalization, so a normal accepted
Wait cannot turn Task completion into unbounded fanout.

The first match creates one `agent_wait_events` Wake through the existing Agent-level
continuation queue. Further matching facts update that same Wake only while it is
`pending` or `claimed`; `prepared`, `delivered`, and `delivery_unknown` are the durable
batch seal because the Host may already have received the resume envelope. A sealed
one-shot Wait never manufactures a successor turn for later matches. Exact Wake consume
atomically changes `triggered -> resumed`; consume replay is inert. A resumed model reads
the bounded Wait references and independently re-reads each authoritative source Task.
If it still needs future attention it creates a new Wait.

Cancellation is similarly bounded: `waiting`, `pending`, or `claimed` work can be
cancelled/revoked before Host dispatch preparation; cancellation fails closed after the
prepare fence because WebPi can no longer prove that the Host did not receive the
resume message. Server restart preserves Waits, sources, matches, and Wakes but does not
reconstruct process-local Host ownership. The MCP App card reuses the existing Agent
Continuation controller/dispatcher and may poll an exact read-only Wait projection for
presentation; card, Window, Endpoint, Goal, or polling activity grants no source authority
and cannot renew a TaskAttempt lease.

Natural future source kinds include `deadline_reached`, Job terminal state,
Plugin/external completion, and human approval. They should be added only when each has an
authoritative source transition and bounded registration/fanout contract. Wait v1 does
not introduce a timer scheduler, generic event bus, public `publish_event`, recurring
subscription, predicate language, ALL/AND/OR conditions, DAG, reducer, automatic Goal
progression, or automatic successor Task creation.

Goal should remain the deliberately small `active | completed | cancelled` lifecycle.
States such as `implementing`, `waiting_ci`, `waiting_human`, `blocked`, or
`validating` should be derived presentation/attention from correlated durable work and
events unless a later product requirement proves they are independently authoritative
Goal truth. Goal orchestration should create/associate explicit work and react to
durable facts rather than becoming a second execution engine.

Later dogfood may show that many durable Agent Tasks benefit from a runnable-frontier
scheduler. If so, scheduling should derive from durable work and semantic state
transitions, not from browser tabs or UI idle state.

Useful future invariants include:

- planning is advisory; explicit assignment plus claim/dispatch remains authoritative;
- runnable work and live execution reservations drive capacity decisions;
- active execution reservations form a floor only for the carrier class they
  actually consume;
- semantic durable state transitions may create bounded wake pressure; visual UI
  state does not;
- stale workers/carriers cannot renew expired leases or submit late results.

Capacity is therefore potentially per execution class rather than simply
"number of active Agent Tasks = number of ChatGPT windows".

This is a possible later product slice, not an A4b requirement and not WebPi's
north star.

## Dependencies and workflow graphs come later

Do not add dependency DAGs, fan-out/reducers, graph node kinds, conditional routing,
supersteps/barriers, or parent/child Agent orchestration merely because another
system demonstrates them.

First prove:

```text
Agent Task -> exact TaskAttempt -> concrete execution -> exact terminal result
```

Add dependency semantics only after real workflows require `A -> B` or fan-out/join.
Add an explicit workflow graph only after dependency plus conditional-routing use
cases justify a third abstraction layer. Superstep/BSP-style coordination has no
current roadmap commitment.

## Agent Task execution acceptance baseline

A3, A4a, and the implemented A4b establish the current baseline, including the
Endpoint-backed cases below:

| Case | Required result |
| --- | --- |
| two concurrent start/claim requests for one explicitly assigned Agent Task | exactly one authoritative Attempt is created/accepted |
| exact start/claim retry | returns the same Attempt without redispatch |
| heartbeat before lease expiry | succeeds only for exact current Attempt/controller |
| heartbeat after lease expiry | rejected as stale |
| completion after lease expiry | rejected as stale |
| same assigned Agent starts again after expiry | creates a new Attempt |
| different Agent tries after expiry without reassignment | rejected; lease expiry does not transfer assignment |
| authorized explicit reassignment, then new assignee starts | creates a new Attempt for the new current assignee |
| Attempt 1 responds after Attempt 2 exists | Attempt 1 remains permanently stale |
| Endpoint/carrier replacement inside one Attempt | old Attempt controller/binding is fenced |
| CodingAgentRun dispatch response is uncertain | exact durable binding reconciles the authoritative run; no blind second run |
| CodingAgentRun reaches terminal state | reconciliation terminalizes the exact current TaskAttempt once |
| A4b TaskAttempt has no wake-capable Endpoint | work remains durable/pending; no Task failure and no fabricated Conversation Message |
| A4b Wake is consumed | proves one resumed reasoning opportunity only; TaskAttempt remains active until exact completion |
| A4b Endpoint E1 is replaced by E2 inside one Attempt | same Attempt/fence, incremented Attempt controller generation; old E1 turn is stale |
| original continuation selector E1 has already advanced to expired E2 | same authorized Window can discover the authoritative chain and advance to E3 without reviving E1 |
| A4b Host outcome is `delivery_unknown` after dispatch fence | no blind redispatch and no duplicate TaskAttempt |
| Server restart | Agent Task/TaskAttempt truth and accepted replay identities survive; no second logical work item |
| Endpoint detach | Task/Attempt durable state does not disappear |
| duplicate completion | exact replay, no repeated terminal side effect |
| changed replay | idempotency conflict |
| Conversation participant references Agent Task | receives no implicit Agent Task execution authority |
| Agent Task references Project | receives no implicit Project authority |
| unauthorized exact Agent Task/Attempt id | does not disclose foreign-resource existence |

## Explicit non-goals for A4b

The Endpoint-backed execution slice must not expand into:

- a generic swarm scheduler or worker pool;
- automatic Agent spawning or autonomous delegation;
- runnable-frontier/capacity autoscaling;
- dependency DAG, fan-out/reducer, graph DSL, or superstep;
- a universal execution-provider framework;
- Agent parent/child hierarchy;
- a generic durable event bus or Goal scheduler;
- new Goal lifecycle states for execution/presentation phases;
- Agent-scoped Memory migration or Agent Skills;
- federation/A2A compatibility;
- PostgreSQL/distributed multi-Server scheduling;
- a generic Actor/Event/Entity ORM.

The design goal is narrower: make a durable Agent able to own and resume
asynchronous work correctly, with explicit identity, authority, replay, and stale
execution fencing. More automated coordination can grow from that foundation only
when real product use demonstrates the need.
