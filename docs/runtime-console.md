# Runtime Console navigation

Open `/runtime` and connect with an existing runtime credential.

The start page is **Project overview**: choose an authorized project and review
**Needs attention**, **Working now**, **Recently closed**, and recent work Sessions.
Counts describe loaded evidence; unavailable or stale data is not an empty healthy
workspace. Closed does not imply successful. Each Session opens explicitly, with a
work summary of retained edits, Jobs, and terminal validation before the message board.
The summary is not a live Git diff or host conversation transcript.

Press **Command+Shift+K** / **Ctrl+Shift+K**, or choose **Commands**, for keyboard
navigation. Escape closes the command dialog and restores focus. These actions
never create a Session or submit a message. Press **Command+K** on macOS or **Ctrl+K** on Windows/Linux
while connected to open Projects & Sessions and focus project search. On narrow
screens this also opens the navigation drawer. These shortcuts navigate only;
they do not create Sessions or send messages.

- **Work Sessions** is the collaboration workspace. Select a Project and
  Workflow Session in the sidebar. Recent Sessions starts expanded and can be
  collapsed when more room is needed.
- **Context** opens the selected Session's context. **Overview** shows work,
  attention, validation, and model-reported progress directly. **Activity** shows
  retained events and the existing follow-latest control. **Details** shows
  identity, lifecycle, mode, timestamps, and workspace information.
- **Diagnostics & Agents** provides three secondary destinations: **Overview**,
  **Runner fleet**, and **Durable Agents**. Selecting a destination
  shows its full content and updates the navigation highlight. Switching
  destinations keeps existing forms mounted so unsent input is retained.
- **Window activity** is a first-class navigation destination and also appears in
  Project overview. Adapter `_meta["openai/session"]` is hashed into a `ClientWindow`,
  separate from explicit `wc_sess_*` Workflow Sessions. This is an observability view
  for ChatGPT/WebPi call correlation. It
  lists hashed `ClientWindow` identities, current in-flight WebPi requests,
  bounded durable call history, linked Workflow Sessions, and explicit recorder
  continuity gaps. It never shows the raw host window value, tool arguments or
  outputs, and it cannot observe model reasoning or determine whether a host UI
  is frozen. Window/Session links are many-to-many evidence only: they do not
  select a Workflow Session, grant Project authority, or make a Window an
  execution/continuity owner.

For ordinary non-streaming `tools/call`, Window activity can project three timing
facts from canonical adapter timestamps: `service_ms` is request-observed to
response-handoff time, `next_call_gap_ms` is response handoff to the next
meaningful same-Window/same-principal request, and `cycle_ms` is request start to
the next meaningful request start. The gap is explicitly outside-WebPi time;
it may include network, host scheduling, model inference, user interaction, or
other unobservable work and is never presented as model think/reasoning time.
Status/discovery calls and MCP App controller/polling calls (including Goal Plan state and Agent continuation bind/state/acquire/prepare/finish/recovery/unbind traffic) remain ordinary Window-seen evidence but do not count as meaningful business activity or break the meaningful sequence. Model visibility is not the classifier: real read/search/edit/Git/process/validation/work calls remain meaningful. Overlapping calls
are classified as overlap rather than producing a negative serial gap. Streaming
handoff is not stream completion, and a Server restart loses process-local prior
completion state, so both cases leave ordinary next-call timing unavailable.
A meaningful request consumes its predecessor at arrival; cancellation and hard
timeout also break continuity until a later eligible response establishes a new
anchor.
Legacy ActionAudit `window_ended_at_ms` remains the audit-record boundary and is
not used as the HTTP response-handoff performance timestamp.

When the experimental Code Mode feature is enabled, one outer `code_mode_exec` Window activity may also show a bounded composition projection: nested call/success/failure counts, maximum nested in-flight concurrency, Code Mode duration, input/returned bytes, nested raw-result bytes, and counts for the explicit admitted nested tool names. These fields come from the same outer ActionAudit row. Nested canonical calls do **not** create synthetic Window activities, and the projection never includes JavaScript source, nested arguments/results, paths, queries, commands, credentials, arbitrary error strings, or raw Window identity.

The context panel still adapts between a docked rail, popover, and mobile sheet.
Closing it leaves a labeled Context entry in the header. Context navigation uses
ordinary keyboard-focusable buttons, with the current choice announced as pressed.
Mobile operation navigation closes after selection and focuses the destination.

These are presentation changes. Workflow Session and durable Agent identities,
credential scopes, refresh behavior, and mutation handling keep their existing
contracts. Model-reported progress remains informational.

The Windows list and detail routes require `runtime:read`. Non-admin callers are
first principal-filtered and then re-projected through current canonical Project
authority, so revoked Project access cannot leave a Window timestamp, Session
count, gap count, timing projection, or direct-key existence oracle. Session detail itself keeps its
existing Project-read contract; without `runtime:read` it reports Window activity
as unavailable instead of elevating the whole Session read to a runtime-wide
permission requirement. Durable terminal history is backed by ActionAudit, while
currently-running requests are process-local and intentionally disappear on
Server restart. The dedicated Windows refresh is three seconds only while that
view is selected and the page is foregrounded; the normal Runtime Console refresh
cadence is unchanged.

Each selected Project/workspace has its own keyboard-accessible disclosure below
its Runner. Closing it hides that workspace's Sessions without clearing the
selected Session or composer; its preference survives refresh. Selecting another
workspace opens its Session list.

At widths of 1600px and above, Context docks beside a narrower conversation, with
more room for readable status and progress. Its Overview starts with the latest
retained Agent-authored message. Resolution text is also visible directly below
the original message, rather than only in a tooltip.

Project search continues to query authorized Projects by name, id, Runner, or
workspace path. Separate searches filter the loaded Sessions by title/id/lifecycle
and retained messages by body, resolution, id, or author Session. Match counts
refer only to loaded results; these controls do not search unretained history or
host transcripts and do not change the selected Session. Expand **Search retained
messages** above the board to filter messages. Its match count stays visible when
collapsed; closing the search keeps the current filter.

The Session board is not a mirrored host chat transcript. An observed ACK records
an explicit model-context acknowledgement, not a reply, read receipt, or completed
work. Model replies appear only when explicitly posted to the Session; reported
progress is separately labeled as informational. An empty latest-message card
means no Agent message exists in the currently retained window.
