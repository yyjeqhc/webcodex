# Safe Delete Native Plugin

`safe_delete` is a dependency-free WebCodex Native Tool Plugin that moves one
ordinary file or directory to the operating system Trash/Recycle Bin instead of
permanently deleting it.

It is intentionally a Plugin rather than a built-in WebCodex filesystem tool.
Install it only on Runners where you want the model to have this additional
local capability.

## Safety contract

- The Plugin provider `cwd` is the deletion authority root. `path` is always
  relative to that directory.
- Absolute paths, `..` traversal, the authority root itself, paths that resolve
  outside the root, symlinks/junctions, and non-file/non-directory entries fail
  closed.
- One call handles exactly one path. There is no batch mode and no `force`
  option.
- An already-absent path is a successful no-op, but the tool is deliberately
  **not** declared idempotent: after an uncertain result, a new object may have
  been created at the same relative path. Never retry an unknown result blindly.
- Backend timeout, a backend failure after the original path disappears, or an
  unverifiable postcondition returns `outcome=unknown`; inspect the path and
  Trash before retrying.
- There is **no permanent-delete fallback for the requested path**. The Plugin never
  uses `rm`, `unlink`, `Remove-Item`, or an equivalent operation to dispose of
  the requested file or directory.

This protects against ordinary model/operator path mistakes. It is not a
sandbox against a hostile process racing filesystem names while the Trash API
is running.

## Platform backends

| Platform | Backend |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | freedesktop.org Home Trash (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash`) using same-filesystem atomic rename; then `gio trash`; then `trash-put` only when `gio` is not installed |
| macOS | Foundation `NSFileManager` Trash API through built-in JXA (`/usr/bin/osascript -l JavaScript`), with the path passed as argv |
| Windows | PowerShell + `Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO` with `SendToRecycleBin` |

If no supported backend is available, the operation fails without deleting the
path. The built-in Linux backend deliberately refuses cross-filesystem copy +
unlink; it falls through to another Trash backend instead.

## Runner configuration

Set `cwd` to the exact project/root you want this Plugin to be allowed to trash
from. Use an absolute path to the Plugin script when the Plugin code lives
outside that root:

```toml
[plugins]
request_timeout_secs = 30

[[plugins.providers]]
id = "safe-delete"
name = "Safe Delete"
command = "node"
args = ["/absolute/path/to/webcodex/plugins/safe-delete/plugin.mjs"]
cwd = "/absolute/path/to/project"
timeout_secs = 30
```

During development, use the normal Plugin loop:

```text
plugin_tool check
-> plugin_tool reload
-> plugin_tool list
-> plugin_tool describe
-> plugin_tool call
```

Restart the Runner when you want the newly admitted `safe_delete` tool to become
eligible for first-class startup exposure.

## Tool

```text
safe_delete({"path":"build/old-output.bin"})
```

Possible structured outcomes are `trashed`, `already_absent`, `rejected`,
`failed`, and `unknown`.

## Development

No npm install is required:

```bash
node --check plugins/safe-delete/plugin.mjs
node --test plugins/safe-delete/plugin.test.mjs
```
