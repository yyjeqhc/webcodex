//! Shared post-register agent session loop.
//!
//! Both long-lived agent transports — WebSocket (`agent_ws`) and custom QUIC
//! (`agent_quic`) — run the *same* session once a connection is registered:
//! a request pump that drains the shared registry queue and pushes `Request`
//! envelopes, a reader loop that dispatches `Result`/`PersistentShellResult`/
//! `JobUpdate`/`Ping`/`Pong`/`RuntimeMetadata`/`Goodbye` envelopes into the
//! connection-scoped registry lease, and a teardown that stops the pump, joins
//! the writer, and reconciles the disconnect. The only differences are the
//! wire I/O (how a frame is read or written) and a log label. This module owns
//! that shared loop; the two
//! transport modules own transport-specific registration, auth, and I/O.
//!
//! Connection-lease scoping: every registry call below takes the
//! `connection_id` so a stale same-instance reconnect cannot consume or
//! refresh the newer connection's lease. This mirrors the polling transport's
//! `*_for_connection` discipline.
